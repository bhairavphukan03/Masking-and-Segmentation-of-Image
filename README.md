# Masking-and-Segmentation-of-Image
We have used OpenCV in our code. In the image below we have tried to use  image masking to process the image further. Masking is used in Image Processing to output the Region of Interest, or  simply the part of the image that we are interested in. We tend to use bit-wise operations for masking as it allows us to discard the parts of the image that we do not need. In the image given to us we have tried to draw contour lines  using cv.drawContours function. The contours are a useful tool for shape  analysis and object detection and recognition.
